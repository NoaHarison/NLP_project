# NLP_project
Project in Artificial Intelligence, focused on training neural networks for Natural Language Processing (NLP), under the supervision of Dr. Moshe Amity and in collaboration with Dr. Chaya Libeskind. This project aims to apply advanced language models (LLM) to classify and generate language for children, specifically targeting early childhood language. The research explores a relatively uncharted area of NLP focused on young children's language, working on both classification and text generation tasks. Our current goal is to train a language model that, given a child's text, can predict the child's age.
